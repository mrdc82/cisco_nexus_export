# cisco_nexus_export
Export show commands to file

Select a text file with list of ip's of cisco nexus devices.
There is a commented out show_cmd, the purpose of that is i needed to have the vrf output in its own seperate file.
Be sure that when you run the script a second time, that you have renamed or moved your first output files. as it will write to the same file.
